</header><div class="entry-content"><h2>Auto Accident Injuries and Deaths</h2>
<p>Every year about 3 million people in America are injured as a result of traffic accidents and collisions. Crash related injuries are costly with medical costs and lost productivity estimated with injuries and deaths exceeding $75 billion in 2017 alone. (CDC statistics from its website www.cdc.gov)</p>
<p>On average, in 2018, more than 100 people per day died in the U.S. from motor vehicle crashes. In 2014 and 2015, crashes involving teenagers 17 to 18 years old were the leading cause of death for U.S. teens.  Motor vehicle  crash deaths are  3 to 10 times higher in rural areas. ( www.cdc.gov ) These numbers show that injuries and death on America’s roadways can be devastating.</p>
<p>Every day people are driving to get to and from work, back and forth to school, shopping trips, to visit with friends or family, vacation road trips, or just for the fun of it. If you have become one of those injured in a traffic accident or other vehicle related incident that was not your fault, you may have rights under the law. There are rules of the road that drivers  must obey. If a driver fails to obey these rules, that driver can be held legally at fault and responsible to pay for the injuries and losses he or she has caused.  A skilled personal injury lawyer with experience in representing accident victims can help get you money damages as fair compensation for your injuries.</p>
<h2><strong>Automobile Insurance and Accident Claims.  </strong></h2>
<p>Pennsylvania requires all car owners to have auto insurance to register their vehicle.  Failure to have auto insurance will result in fines or other penalties under the law.  When you are injured in a crash or other motor vehicle accident, you need to contact your auto insurance company promptly. Your auto insurance policy can be difficult to understand but an injury lawyer can help explain what your policy provides to help you after an injury.  All PA auto policies must be sold with at least $5,000 of medical benefits (“First Party Benefits” or PIP benefits) so that regardless of who was at fault, you can get treated and your auto insurance will pay for reasonable and necessary treatment.  In PA, insurance companies must also offer wage loss benefits as an option (which can be declined by the policy holder) to pay you if you cannot work when injured in a vehicle related incident.</p>
<p><strong>No Insurance? Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Claims. </strong>All too often people let their auto insurance lapse- they forget to pay the monthly premium bill or may not have the money to continue paying for a policy.  When these drivers cause an injury with an uninsured vehicle, you may still be able to recover money damages if you have the right coverage on your auto policy.  You need to review your auto policy with an experienced injury lawyer to protect your rights in these situations.</p>
<p><strong>Uninsured Motorist (UM) Coverage,</strong></p>
<p>This a mandatory offer to all PA car owners when purchasing a new policy.  If you have UM coverage, you have rights to claim money damages for your injuries from your insurance company. In turn, your insurance company can then seek reimbursement from the uninsured driver. All auto policies that may apply to you either as a car owner or as a family member in the same household of another insured vehicle may provide multiple sources of UM coverage. If you were injured while in an employer’s vehicle, that may be another source or UM coverage to pay for your losses.  A skilled injury lawyer can help you find more potential policies as a source of money damages for you.</p>
<p><strong>Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Coverage.</strong></p>
<p>This is another mandatory offer to all PA car owners when purchasing a policy.  When you have UIM coverage, you are protected when the vehicle owner or driver at fault for your injuries does not have enough insurance coverage to pay for all your harms and losses when injured.  In Pennsylvania, car owners can purchase as little as $15,000 of bodily injury insurance to be legally insured. This is often called the “mandatory minimum” amount of coverage.  In serious cases, this mandatory minimum of $15,000 is hardly enough to provide full and fair compensation for harms and losses that could include months of lost wages, permanent disability, loss of a limb, permanent scarring or disfigurement, paralysis, other devastating injuries or loss of life.  As in UM situations, there may be multiple auto policies that provide coverage for such injuries and a personal injury lawyer who is knowledgeable in auto insurance can help make sure that all polices that may apply are found.</p>
<h3><strong>Hit and Run Drivers or “Phantom” Vehicles and Uninsured Motorist (UM) Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>There times when another driver causes a crash and then fails to stop as required to exchange information or aid. This is a crime but in some situations there is not information to identify and find the fleeing driver.  If you have Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage on your vehicle or the vehicle you were in at the time of the crash, you can still recover money damages but first you need to promptly report the crash to the police as soon as possible. You need to check your auto policy about this, but in any event you should report this as soon as possible, no more than 5 days or less after it happened. If there was more than one vehicle that caused the crash, then be sure to report this to the investigating office who is there at the scene.  This can be the situation in a “chain reaction” crash or where an oncoming vehicle swerves into the opposite lane and then drives away from the scene.</p>
<h2><strong>What To Do When In An Auto Accident</strong></h2>
<p>You have just been in a collision. If you are lucky not to have been seriously injured, you should try to stay calm and take some basic steps to help your claim getting resolved fairly.  The law requires that you exchange information (driver license and auto insurance card) at the scene.  If the vehicles are too damaged to be driven or there are injuries, the police and emergency services (ambulance, EMT) are needed.  You should not make any statements about fault to the other driver. However, the investigating police officer will ask you about how the crash happened.  You should be sure to describe whatever the other driver did that caused the crash. Also, if there were any other factors such as another vehicle that fled the scene, a malfunctioning traffic light, poorly placed sign, road hazard, or other such causes for the crash, you need to tell the officer about this.</p>
<p>If you have a camera or cell phone, you can take photos at the scene of the damage to the vehicles or other property, skid  marks, traffic control signs, obstructions or other important factors.  If anyone comes forward at the scene as a witness, you should get their name, address and phone number.  Having this information can help to get the claim resolved more quickly and more favorably for you.</p>
<p>If you are injured, especially if you have suffered a serious injury, it is important to get help as soon as possible.  You need to get the police and emergency services there at the scene. Of course, in most serious injury situations, you may not be able to move or are in too much pain to act.  If you have passengers with you, they may be able to help get you help and get the important information at the scene for you.</p>
